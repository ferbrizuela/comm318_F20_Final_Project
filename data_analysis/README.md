## Cleaning Data

First we have the folder:

`COMM318_F20_Final_Project/data_analysis/Cleaning_Data`

This folder contains the workbook where I cleaned my raw data: 

`Cleaning_Full_Music_Sales_Data.ipynb`

Additionally, there is an "Old_Data" folder inside, which includes the workbooks where I cleaned the initial data that I didn't end up using. 

## Exploration and Analysis
Next we have 4 workbooks in which I carried out all of my analyses. 

`Mapping_Music_Formats.ipynb`
* I did some further cleaning in this folder. I created a map to add a new column. I did this to categorize each format into three main groups: Analog, Digital, and Streaming, to carry out analyses. I decided to do this because some individual formats didn't contribute significantly to sales, so grouping them into columns gave a bigger picture of the impact formats had on sales volumes and revenue. 
    
`Exploring_and_Analyzing_Revenue_Data.ipynb`
* This is where I analyzed the data corresponding to music sales in terms of _revenue_. My analyses included creating visuals and looking at trends throughout the years, form 1973 to 2019. 

`Exploring_and_Analyzing_Revenue_Data.ipynb`
* I carried out the same analyses as the workbook above, but working with data corresponding to music sales in terms of _volume_.

`Exploring_Specific_Years_and_Formats.ipynb`
* In this workbook, I broke down my analysis further into specific years. I analyzed music sales volume and revenue one year at a time for years that impacted general trends(1973, 1999, 2008, 2014, and 2019). I looked at the role of specific music formats in these years. In the other files, I analyzed my data in terms of Mode: Analog, Digital, and Streaming. In this one, I looked into specific formats: CD, LP/EP, Single Downloads, etc. 

## Early Exploration

Finally, we have the folder: 

`COMM318_F20_Final_Project/data_analysis/Initial_Exploration`

This contains workbooks from my early stages of exploration. The files aren't really relevant to my final draft of the project, as most of them contain the original data I planned to use. However, this early exploration allowed me to pinpoint which questions I wanted to answer and discover which data would actually be helpful in carrying out my analysis.
