# Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

Here is my data story! In this story I will be answering the questions:

## How has the introduction of new music formats affected music sales? 

## How have different formats changed the way consumers interact with music?

## How have these changes affected the music industry economically? 

My data story took the form of a journalistic article. The writing is more informal so I envision it as a piece belonging more to a magazine rather than a newspaper. I incorporated my data by including some visuals and graphs that I worked on in my analysis and exploration. 

My article is titled: "The Way We Listen to Music is Changing... And it Affects an Entire Industry" and it can be found in the workbook `Final_Presentation.ipynb`

There is an additional folder inside titled `Photo_Files` this is where all the pictures I used in my article are stored. 

I really enjoyed looking into this topic and writing about it, I hope you enjoy it as well! Thank you!
