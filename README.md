## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

# How Music Sales Have Changed Throughout the Years

I have always been a music fan. I not only listen to music every day, but I also like to enagage with artists online and attend events such as concerts and signigns. The music industry has always been fascinating to me. The fact that developments in technology constantly change the way we interact with music is extremely interesting.

For my project, I decided to look at a dataset from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which includes data from 1973 to 2019. The data contains information about music sales in terms of volumes and revenue. It further breaks down this information into specific formats, such as LP/EP, CD, Digital Singles, etc. 

Since the data included many formats that did not contribute significantly to sales, I decided to group them into larger categories. I grouped the formats into different "Modes" which are: Analog, Digital, and Streaming. 

The questions I focused on were: 

## How has the introduction of new music formats affected music sales? 

To answer this question, I looked at trends pertaining to music sales volumes in terms of units sold. I created visuals to look at the way music sales volumes have changed. I found that major changes in music sales (increases or decreases) corresponded to the introduction of new formats into the market. For example, sales volumes began to rise in the early 1980s, and CDs first began to be sold in 1983. 

## How have different formats changed the way consumers interact with music? 

For this question, I looked into the most popular formats throughout the years. I found that in the beginning of the digital age, CD physical albums were the most sold. People bought and experienced their music as full albums. As digital dowloads became more prevalent, however, Digital Singles became the most popular. Now that people could easily download music and had more flexibility and variety, they opted to buy individual songs rather than full albums. 

Looking at these trends, it was clear that digital music led to significant increases in music sales. That certainly sounds like a good thing, but is it? As digital music became more popular, it became easier to attain... and also cheaper. This led to my next question. 

## How have these changes affected the music industry economically? 

In terms of revenue, I carried out similar analyses that I looked at for music sales volume. The trends were different to sales volume, which indicated that a rise in volume did not necessarily entail an increase in revenue. When looking at revenue, Streaming came into the picture as it was more relevant in the revenue data. Streaming was not relevant in the volume data as units cannot be easily quantifiable since streaming does not entail ownership of the music. 

## Changes to my project

Originally, I wanted to look at the way individual formats affected the music industry. I had two datasets, one for music sales volume and one for revenue, that dated back to 2000. However, I soon found that there were too many formats, and only a couple contributed significantly in terms of sales in the last twenty years. This is when I decided to group the formats into Analog, Digital, and Streaming. After this grouping, I realized that Analog wasn't very relevant since 2000. So I decided that I wanted to see the way these changes in mode have affected music sales, obtaining data dating back to 1973 to look at major trends. 

Ultimately I wrote a journalistic article answering the questions above. It is written more informally, so it would probably be fit for something more like a magazine. I incorporated my data by including some visuals I worked in during my exploration and analysis. 

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my presentation!
