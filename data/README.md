## Data files for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

My Data folder contains 2 folders. 

The most relevant is:

`COMM318_F20_Final_Project/data/Usable_Data`

This folder includes the data that I ultimately analyzed and explored for my project, which I gathered from the [Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)](https://www.riaa.com/u-s-sales-database/). The RIAA maintains a database with details of music sales in terms of volume and revenue from 1973 to 2019. 

My Usable_Data folder contains 3 files:
* `Full_Music_Sales_Data_Raw.csv`
* `Full_Music_Sales_Data_Clean.csv`
* `Usable_Music_Sales_Data.csv`

These are the files with the raw data, clean data, and usable data as indicated in the names. The difference between the "clean" and "usable" data is that the usable data contains an additional column. I created a map to divide each music format into three separate categories (or "Modes"): Analog, Digital, and Streaming. I carried out all my analyses and exploration with the usable data file. 

Next folder is:

`COMM318_F20_Final_Project/data/Old_Data`

This folder contains all of the old data that I started with. Originally, I was looking into two different data sets (also from the RIAA), one corresponding to music sales _volume_ and the other to music sales _revenue_ (now they are in the same dataset). These sets only included data from 2000 to 2019 and I decided I wanted to analyze data from earlier years, which is why I ended up getting more data. 

The folder includes the two original raw data files, as well as the two clean files, and finally two data sets that Professor O'Donnell uploaded to help me with a couple of questions I had regarding my data. 

The files are: 
* `Music_Sales_Volume_Data.csv`
* `Music_Sales_Revenue_Data.csv`
* `Music_Sales_Volume_Clean.csv`
* `Music_Sales_Revenue_Clean.csv`
* `Full_Data2_1973_2019.csv`
* `Full_Data_1973_2019.csv`
